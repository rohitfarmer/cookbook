    "text": "7.3 Wine\n\n7.3.1 Red\nDifferent types of red wine each have unique characteristics that make them suitable for pairing with various foods. Red wines can be categorized based on their sweetness levels, from dry to sweet.\nHere’s a brief overview:\n\nCabernet Sauvignon: A full-bodied red wine, it pairs well with hearty dishes like steak, lamb, and heavy stews.\n\nSweetness: Typically very dry.\n\nMerlot: Softer than Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot goes well with lighter meats like chicken and other poultry.\n\nSweetness: Usually dry, with a slight perception of sweetness due to its fruity flavors.\n\nPinot Noir: A lighter-bodied red, it’s excellent with dishes like salmon, mushroom-based dishes, and grilled meats.\n\nSweetness: Generally dry\n\nSyrah/Shiraz: Known for its bold flavor, it pairs nicely with spicy dishes, barbecued meats, and game.\n\nSweetness: Mostly dry, but some styles (especially those from warmer regions) can have a hint of sweetness.\n\nZinfandel: A medium to full-bodied wine that works well with spicy cuisine, pizza, and hearty pasta dishes.\n\nSweetness: Ranges from dry to off-dry (slightly sweet), especially in the case of some American Zinfandels.\n\nMalbec: With its robust flavor, it’s great with red meats, particularly beef, and spicy dishes.\n\nSweetness: Predominantly dry\n\nSangiovese: This Italian wine is ideal with Italian cuisine, particularly tomato-based pasta dishes and pizza.\n\nSweetness: Usually dry\n\nTempranillo: Common in Spanish wines, it pairs well with tapas, grilled meats, and Mexican dishes.\n\nSweetness: Typically dry\n\nBarbera: Another Italian variety, it’s versatile and pairs well with a range of foods including light meats, pasta, and savory cheese dishes.\n\nSweetness: Predominantly dry\n\n\nRemember, the perception of sweetness in wine is not just about sugar content; factors like fruitiness, alcohol level, and acidity can influence how sweet a wine tastes. For instance, a wine with high fruit flavors might seem sweeter, even if it doesn’t have residual sugar.\n\n\n7.3.2 White\nDifferent white wine types each have unique characteristics and pair well with various foods.\nHere are some common types:\n\nChardonnay: A versatile wine that can range from rich and buttery to fresh and fruity. It pairs well with fish like salmon, chicken, and dishes with a creamy sauce.\n\nSweetness: Usually dry, though some styles can have a slight sweetness.\n\nSauvignon Blanc: Known for its crisp, dry, and refreshing taste with hints of green herbs. It goes well with goat cheese, green vegetables like asparagus and zucchini, and dishes with fresh herbs.\n\nSweetness: Typically very dry with sharp acidity.\n\nPinot Grigio/Gris: A light, crisp wine often with citrus or pear notes. It’s great with seafood, light pastas, and cheese-cracker combinations.\n\nSweetness: Generally dry with a crisp finish.\n\nRiesling: Can be sweet or dry, with a fruity and floral aroma. Pairs beautifully with spicy dishes, pork, and sweet desserts.\n\nSweetness: Can vary greatly but often falls into the off-dry category. Some Rieslings are very sweet, while others are quite dry.\n\nMoscato: Typically sweet with hints of peaches and nectarines. It’s excellent with lighter desserts, fruit-based dishes, and sometimes spicy Asian cuisine.\n\nSweetness: Known for its sweet profile with flavors of peach and nectarine.\n\nGewürztraminer: Aromatic and sweet, with notes of tropical fruits. It complements spicy and flavorful Asian dishes, smoked meats, and richer cheeses.\n\nSweetness: Often off-dry, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by acidity.\n\n\n\n7.3.2.1 Summary\n\nDry Wines: Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio/Gris\nOff-Dry (Slightly Sweet) Wines: Riesling, Gewürztraminer\nSweet Wines: Moscato",
