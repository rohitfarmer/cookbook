## Cherry Tomato Salad

**Ingredients**

1. Fresh cherry or grape tomatoes.
2. Fresh mozzarella salad pearls: If you canâ€™t find this small size, just buy a fresh mozzarella ball and dice it up (Optional; think about cholesterol).
3. Extra virgin olive oil.
4. Garlic
5. Red wine vinegar: white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar will work fine.
6. Fresh basil and parsley: if needed, use dried basil or parsley instead of fresh (using 1/3 the amount listed).
7. Dried oregano: Of course, fresh oregano will work great too. Use 1 1/2 tsp minced.
8. Honey: only a hint of this is added to help balance the acidity and lightly emulsify the dressing.
9. Salt and pepper to taste.

**Steps**

1. To make tomato salad dressing, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, honey, parsley, basil, and oregano in a mixing bowl, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
2. Toss tomatoes and mozzarella with dressing: In a medium salad bowl, toss tomatoes with dressing. Add mozzarella and toss.
