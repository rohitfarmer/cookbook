### Red

Different types of red wine each have unique characteristics that make them suitable for pairing with various foods. Red wines can be categorized based on their sweetness levels, from dry to sweet.

Here's a brief overview:



1. **Cabernet Sauvignon**: A full-bodied red wine, it pairs well with hearty dishes like steak, lamb, and heavy stews.
    1. Sweetness: Typically very dry.
2. **Merlot:** Softer than Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot goes well with lighter meats like chicken and other poultry.
    2. Sweetness: Usually dry, with a slight perception of sweetness due to its fruity flavors.
3. **Pinot Noir:** A lighter-bodied red, it's excellent with dishes like salmon, mushroom-based dishes, and grilled meats.
    3. Sweetness: Generally dry
4. **Syrah/Shiraz:** Known for its bold flavor, it pairs nicely with spicy dishes, barbecued meats, and game.
    4. Sweetness: Mostly dry, but some styles (especially those from warmer regions) can have a hint of sweetness.
5. **Zinfandel:** A medium to full-bodied wine that works well with spicy cuisine, pizza, and hearty pasta dishes.
    5. Sweetness: Ranges from dry to off-dry (slightly sweet), especially in the case of some American Zinfandels.
6. **Malbec:** With its robust flavor, it's great with red meats, particularly beef, and spicy dishes.
    6. Sweetness: Predominantly dry
7. **Sangiovese:** This Italian wine is ideal with Italian cuisine, particularly tomato-based pasta dishes and pizza.
    7. Sweetness: Usually dry

Remember, the perception of sweetness in wine is not just about sugar content; factors like fruitiness, alcohol level, and acidity can influence how sweet a wine tastes. For instance, a wine with high fruit flavors might seem sweeter, even if it doesn't have residual sugar.
