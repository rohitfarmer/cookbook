## Pink Grapefruit And Avocado Slices In Dijon Mustard Vinaigrette

Cut the grapefruit and avocado into slices and place them in pairs. Dress them with a layer of Dijon mustard vinaigrette.

**Ingredients for the vinaigrette**

1. 1 rounded tablespoon Dijon mustard 
2. 1 ½ tablespoons red wine vinegar or sherry vinegar
3. 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
4. Salt to taste
5. Freshly ground pepper
6. ½ cup extra virgin olive oil, or use half olive oil and half canola or grapeseed oil
7. 1 small garlic clove

**Steps to make the vinaigrette**

Combine the mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a small bowl or measuring cup. Whisk in the oil.
Peel the garlic clove and lightly crush, or cut down to the root end with a paring knife, keeping the garlic clove intact. Place in the dressing and allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes. Remove from the dressing before serving.
